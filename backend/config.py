    # verification containers via the host Docker socket — conflating any two
    # of them is exactly what makes bind mounts silently fail to resolve:
    #   1. HOST_DATA_DIR              — where ./data lives on the HOST filesystem
    #                                   (what the HOST Docker daemon can mount).
    #   2. BACKEND_CONTAINER_DATA_DIR — where that same ./data is mounted INSIDE
    #                                   the backend container (docker-compose.yml
    #                                   mounts it at /app/data).
    #   3. VERIFICATION_CONTAINER_WORKDIR — where the worktree is bind-mounted
