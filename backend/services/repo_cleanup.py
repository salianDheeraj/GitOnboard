"""
Repository-scoped filesystem and object-storage cleanup for repository deletion.

Deleting a Repository row cascades to its Analysis/AnalysisArtifact/AnalysisJob/FactFile
rows at the database level (see backend/models/repository.py and
backend/models/fact_store.py — cascade="all, delete-orphan" plus ON DELETE CASCADE), but
the database has never been the only place repository state lives:

- Azure Blob Storage / Azurite holds the actual file contents, keyed by
  `repositories/{repository_id}/...` (backend/storage/naming.py).
- data/worktrees/ holds sandbox worktrees populated from that Fact Store snapshot.
- data/repos/ is a legacy/vestigial local-cache location (no longer written by the
  ingestion pipeline — see backend/services/worker.py — but cleaned up here for hygiene
  in case it exists from an older build).

None of these are deleted by `db.delete(repo)` alone. Left behind, they cause exactly the
bug this module fixes: re-importing a repository with the same name reuses a stale worktree
that was never wiped, so "delete then reload" does not produce a clean snapshot.

Cleanup here is scoped strictly to the repository being deleted:
- Blob storage is scoped by `repository_id`, which is a real, unique, database-assigned
  identity — no other repository's blobs share that prefix.
- Worktree directories are identified either by an exact name match (the same repo_name
  string every other part of this codebase already uses as the run_id/worktree key), or by
  their WorktreeProvisioner provenance marker recording this exact `repository_id` — never
  by fuzzy substring/prefix matching against other repositories' names.

All steps are best-effort and independently logged: a filesystem or storage error here must
never block the database deletion the user actually asked for, but must also never be
reported as silent success — failures are logged at warning/error level for operators.
